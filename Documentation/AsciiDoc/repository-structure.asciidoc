== Introduction
The project was made open-source as of January, 2014 with a Git repository hosted on Github. The repository is public and pull requests are most welcome. The repository, just like the suite itself, has a proper directory structure/file system. This enables us to segregate documentation, release and source code facilitating development and maintenance.

== Directory Structure
Just like the file system, all files and directories come under the root directory, marked here as "/". The following table lists directories and some important subdirectories along with their descriptions.
